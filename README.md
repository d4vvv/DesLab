As a Design Labory project, we decided to teach JetBot how to go through a labyrinth with prepared signs.
We used the method called transfer learning to retrained the Alexnet network with photos of circles, squares, arrows as well as free and blocked space.

It reacts in the following way:
* red circle - go right
* green square - stop 
* blue arrow - go left
